  o Minor bugfixes (compatibility):
    - Strip '\r' characters when reading text files on Unix platforms.
      This should resolve an issue where a relay operator migrates a relay from
      Windows to Unix, but does not change the line ending of Tor's various state
      files to match the platform, the CRLF line endings from Windows ends up leaking
      into other files such as the extra-info document. Fixes bug 33781; bugfix on
      0.0.9pre5.
