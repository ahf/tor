  o Code simplification and refactoring (bootstrap):
    - We simplify the PT and Proxy handling code in Tor such that PT's are no
      longer considered a Proxy itself. This allows us to be more specific
      during bootstrap in cases where a PT itself might also have to use a proxy for
      connectivity. Implements ticket 28930.
